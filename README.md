# 2023 MEET MITT project: Wordle
On 25-04-2023, a number of grade 10 students visited MITT for a demonstration of what the grades 11 & 12 PTEC program had to offer them.  During the demonstration for the Software Developer stream, this project was coded live. 

The live coding demonstration was limited to 15 minutes, and the initial commit for this repository represents the state of code that was achieved within that limit.  Further commits represent the completion and hosting of the project so that those students can see the completed work.
